Kirkstone is not currently supported.  We are experimenting with enabling the
Yocto Project LTS branch, but are not currently testing this version.

If you are using this version and find any issues, please report them to the

   meta-xilinx@lists.yoctoproject.org

mailing list.  While we can not promise that it will get priority, patches
or forward / back port requests are welcome.
